Using the AddKeywords metadata plugin which will also generate a meta description for the article (see below)."
FG_USE_ADDKEYWORDS="Use AddKeywords Plugin"

You can apply your own blacklist and whitelist for all you ordinary articles and the articles generated by FeedGator. 2. You can generate a meta description for each article which is favoured by search engines. If this is set to no then the default word extraction is used. This parameter has no effect if meta tag computation is not enabled."

FG_USE_YAHOO_DESC="If set to yes then FeedGator will use the Yahoo API to analyze and extract relevant terms from RSS content and save them as tags (meta keywords). Relevant terms can be single words or complete phrases, and this method may provide a more effective analysis of feed content than the default word extraction algorithm. This is the recommended meta tag computation method. If this is set to no then the default word extraction is used. To use this feature you MUST PROVIDE A VALID APPLICATION ID (see below). This parameter has no effect if meta tag computation is not enabled."
FG_YAHOO_ID="Your Yahoo Application ID"
FG_YAHOO_ID_DESC="Your unique Yahoo Application ID is required to use the term extraction feature. A temporary ID is provided with this component to allow you to test it, but you are STRONGLY ADVISED to obtain your own App ID, because there are limits on the volume of requests that one App ID can make to Yahoo. Getting an App ID is free, very easy and instantaneous: http://api.search.yahoo.com/webservices/register_application The temporary ID I've provided is registered in my name, and if I find that people are abusing it, I will disable it - you have been warned!"
FG_MAX_TAGS="Max Number of Tags"
FG_MAX_TAGS_DESC="The maximum number of tags (meta keywords) to save with your content items. The most relevant N tags are saved (Where N is the number you enter here).

FG_MIN_TAGS="Min Characters in Tags"
FG_MIN_TAGS_DESC="The minimum number of characters a tag must contain. Larger numbers here might improve the quality and significance of the tags stored with your data. This only has an effect if Compute Meta Tags is enabled."
FG_IGNORE_LIST="Use Ignore List"
FG_IGNORE_LIST_DESC="Whether or not to use the built-in ignore words list. The default ignore words list contains the 250 most common English words. Enabling the use of the ignore list can improve the quality of your meta tags by excluding common words. The excluded words list currently cannot be easily edited - this will be improved in a future version."
FG_ADDITIONAL_IGNORE_LIST="Ignore List"
FG_ADDITIONAL_IGNORE_LIST_DESC="List of ignore words, use comma as delimitter"
FG_FEED_CATS="Save Feed Categories"
FG_FEED_CATS_DESC="Some RSS feeds include Subject or Category data for their content. If this parameter is set to yes then FeedGator will save the categorical information in the feed as tags (meta keywords) with your content items. The parameter is independent of the 'Compute Meta Tags' parameter - one or the other, both, or neither may be enabled, and category tags are not included in the Max Number of Tags parameter above."
FG_JOOMLA_SEC_CAT="Save Section/Category"
FG_JOOMLA_SEC_CAT_DESC="Set this to yes if you want to store your Joomla section and category names as tags in your imported content. This is similar to the feature found on the Edit Content page of Joomla, except the FeedGator does not store the Title. This parameter is independent of the 'Compute Meta Tags' parameter - one or the other, both, or neither may be enabled, and category tags are not included in the Max Number of Tags parameter above."
